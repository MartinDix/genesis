==========

The next (and probably final) upgrade is to take model analysis data from MARS on
pressure levels and use it to drive the SCM.  For this there needs to be a conversion
between RelH to Specific Humidity as RelH is the only moisture variable output
on pressure levels.

The subroutine 'establ.f' has been taken from the Melbourne Uni GCM and is called
via the -R switch in the command line (see help -h option).

The routine gradz.f90 has also been added to interp_linear.f90 to augment the advective
tendencies of humidity and temperature with a vertical component.

The model is particularly sensitive to vertical velocities, therefore it is recommended
that you use as short a timestep as possible if doing runs of more than a 3 days or so.

Note also that inclusion of all the advective tendencies can constrain the SCM quite
strongly, possibly even overriding particular processes you're interested in so have a
thoughtful approach to the way you're forcing the model and the sensitivities you want
to test.

For longer timesteps you can comment out the vertical advective component for T and q
in interp_linear.f90 and still get good simulations.  Try also switching radiation off
(in CNTLATM) and driving from the surface with TSTAR_FORCING.

There seems to be a bug somewhere in the land surface scheme, so attempting to switch
this on at the moment fails - seems ok in 6.3.
