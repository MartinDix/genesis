README 2.1
**********

Fixes so far are:

1. bug found in vn2.0 'search_grid.f90'
Error if usrlat & data(n) were the same
FIX:
>> modulus function calculates absolute departures rather than +/- 

2. error in same_y and same_x flags not being raised - no check in main.f
FIX:
>> if checks on x(y)index values after find_latlon added to genesis.f90

PROPOSED:
>> Testing of generic NetCDF read routines ncread_dim and ncread_data to remove
the need for separate setups for each reanalysis.  Approach works for diurnal2d
but not sure about odd dimension values of ERA and JRA
