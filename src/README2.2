README 2.2
**********

Now using Greg's upgrade on flurry which has had a few adjustments (mostly
compiler related).  Some search routines have been simplified and array bounds
fixed, however the main change is variable lat/lon input allowing a user to
use SCM in a Lagrangian sense (following a diagnostic of interest).

I intend to import the generic NetCDF read routines from my diurnal2d program - 
will use UM output as initial template and test other NWP formats as they arise,
however every effort should be made to standardise the input NetCDF format prior
to running Genesis - might try and develop a test program.

Update (22/12/2010)

The upgrade of the genesis program is now complete and creates a SCM6.3 namelist
with sensible output.  Genesis can now read the dimensions of the NetCDF fields
directly - now, this works in principle on UM output data but may require a few
tweaks to ensure the array dimensions are in the right order - eg: ERA data has
vertical levels in the opposite direction to the UM (!!)  There is currently no
correction for this - will write it if there is a need.

This completes the 2.2 upgrade.

The question for version 2.3 is how to apply the vertical velocities.  At the moment
advective tendencies of temperature and moisture do not take into account the
vertical advection of the scalar variables of temperature and moisture which puts
it at odds with the formulation of Neggers et al.  Another thing that needs adding
is the Coriolis term in the large scale forcing of momentum: (f(Vg - V)) These are
not major effects but will be necessary for publication of any results (KNMI setup etc...)

Likely will need vertical velocities from the model output (or 'driver' files from KNMI)
- need to plan carefully how to best implement these into the genesis main program.
