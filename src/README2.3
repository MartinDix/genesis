==========

<copied from README2.2>
The question for version 2.3 is how to apply the vertical velocities.  At the moment
advective tendencies of temperature and moisture do not take into account the
vertical advection of the scalar variables of temperature and moisture which puts
it at odds with the formulation of Neggers et al.  Another thing that needs adding
is the Coriolis term in the large scale forcing of momentum: (f(Vg - V)) These are
not major effects but will be necessary for publication of any results (KNMI setup etc...)

Likely will need vertical velocities from the model output (or 'driver' files from KNMI)
- need to plan carefully how to best implement these into the genesis main program.


***********

From interp_linear.f90 the horizontal tendencies are worked out.  Need a call to an
equivalent vertical tendency calculation.  Add a z-component to the gradt and gradq 
calculations (T, q only) and then multiply by omega (using pressure co-ordinates).

Need to read in omega from source input.  If z is available only then multiply by dp/dz to
get omega via chain rule.

25/1/2011: Now both vertical velocities and coriolis terms have been added to the 
calculation of advective tendencies (gradz and geostr subroutines).  Next is to
adapt the namelists to SCM7.5 - a relatively simple fix it turns out, this will be
a change to the 'template' file.  Also, need to check that the p_in and nminin settings
are correct before running.
